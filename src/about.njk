      <p>
        MyWebClass.org is dedicated to teaching visual design history and principles through real, working examples. We believe the best way to understand design movements is to see them fully implemented with authentic attention to typography, layout, color, and interaction patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike static galleries or image collections, our design demos are live, interactive websites that embody the principles they represent. Each demonstration is carefully researched and built to historical accuracy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-brutal">Educational Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We focus on the Swiss Design lineage and related movements, exploring how modernist principles evolved and influenced contemporary design. Each entry in our gallery includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Historical context and origins</li>
        <li>Key characteristics and principles</li>
        <li>Typography and layout guidance</li>
        <li>Color palette analysis</li>
        <li>Live, working demonstration</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="text-brutal">For Students & Educators</h2>
    <p>
      MyWebClass.org serves as a learning resource for design students, web developers, and anyone interested in understanding how design principles translate into practice. Students can submit their own interpretations of design styles, contributing to a growing collection while demonstrating their understanding of design history.
    </p>
    <p>
      All student submissions are reviewed by instructors for historical accuracy and authenticity before being added to the public gallery, ensuring the educational integrity of the collection.
